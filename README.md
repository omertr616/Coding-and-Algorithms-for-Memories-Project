# Coding and Algorithms for Memories Project

### SCS Algorithms

Algorithms to compute the SCS of several sequences when it is known
they all result from a length-n sequence with deletions. For example, assume there is a fixed
number of sequences all received by t deletions from some length-n sequence x. The goal is
to find their SCS with good complexity (better than the multiplication of their lengths).

### Algorithms Presented in This Project:
 1. Dynamic Programming  
 2. Dynamic Programming with 0-1 BFS for 2 Sequences
 3. Dynamic Programming with 0-1 BFS for Three or More Sequences
 4. Dynamic programming with 0-1 BFS for Multiple Sequences


## Getting Started

 These instructions will guide you through setting up and running test cases for the algorithms presented in our project. Follow the steps below to run the tests locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

```
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **C++ Compiler (g++, clang++, or MSVC)**
  - For Windows: [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) or [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
  - For MacOS: `brew install gcc`
  - For Linux: `sudo apt-get install g++`
  
- **Git** (to clone the repository)
  - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Installing
```
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
```
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Coding-and-Algorithms-for-Memories-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Coding-and-Algorithms-for-Memories-Project
   ```

## Running the tests

In this section, we will explain how to run tests for each of the 1-4 algorithms and provide their respective meanings.

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

#### 1. Dynamic Programming  

```
Give an example
```

```
 # Compile the code:
    g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
    
 # If you're using **CMD**, run:
    output_file.exe

 # If you're using **PowerShell**, run:
    ./output_file.exe
```
#### 2. Dynamic Programming with 0-1 BFS for 2 Sequences
#### 3. Dynamic Programming with 0-1 BFS for Three or More Sequences
#### 4. Dynamic programming with 0-1 BFS for Multiple Sequences
